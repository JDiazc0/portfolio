            <p>
              On January 16th I started a new challenge in my career: learning
              Unity through the{" "}
              <a href="https://colombia.generation.org/">Generation Colombia</a>{" "}
              bootcamp. For weeks, I explored the engine, its tools and the best
              practices of video game development.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of the process, I developed <strong>Doppel</strong>, a 2D
              platformer that allowed me to experiment with programming, visual
              design and game mechanics. My goal with this project was not only
              to learn how to use Unity, but also to create a playable
              experience that reflected my growth at this stage.
            </p>

            <h3>What did I do in Doppel?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Programming and mechanics: I implemented the character controls,
                the physics of the game and the logic behind each level.
              </li>
              <li>
                Visual design: I created the stylesheet and defined the
                aesthetics of the game.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collaboration with the community: I used a background of{" "}
                <a href="https://macrune12.itch.io/parallax-forest.">
                  Macrune12
                </a>{" "}
                creator in Itch.io to complement the game art.
              </li>
              <li>
                Level Design: I built the levels looking for a balance between
                challenge and fun.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Structuring the code in Unity to keep it clean and scalable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use of assets and how to integrate them correctly in a game.
              </li>
              <li>Level design and its impact on the player's experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is just the beginning. Doppel was my first step in game
              development and I'm already working on new ideas, see you in the
              next project!
